Imention all of this because on Christmas Day in a select crop of theaters --- and at a couple thousand more theaters in the coming weeks --- Tarantino gave to the world his latest film, The Hateful Eight. Tarantino, almost two decades after McDonagh hit the stage, is now riffing on the playwright. I would question the intentionality of the grift, but that would insult Tarantino's obsession with a genre he defined. The explosive body parts, the climactic sequence in which the floor is covered in blood, the economy of space and time: The Hateful Eight is a reflection of a reflection, and the result is distortion. Like In Bruges, the whipcrack marketing of a western showdown doesn't match the picture. The Hateful Eight is a play about men reckoning with their history, while also humiliating and brutalizing the woman that connects them. It's not a showdown; it's protracted torture show set in a one-room cabin with a set design meant to project to the rear seats. Its large props are lit with sharp white light, like potential weapons on a murder mystery set.
