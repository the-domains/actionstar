            <title><![CDATA[Graphic Novels 2017]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Graphic Novels 2017</h1><p>Imention all of this because on Christmas Day in a select crop of theaters — and at a couple thousand more theaters in the coming weeks — Tarantino gave to the world his latest film, The Hateful Eight. Tarantino, almost two decades after McDonagh hit the stage, is now riffing on the playwright. I would question the intentionality of the grift, but that would insult Tarantino’s obsession with a genre he defined. The explosive body parts, the climactic sequence in which the floor is covered in blood, the economy of space and time: The Hateful Eight is a reflection of a reflection, and the result is distortion. Like In Bruges, the whipcrack marketing of a western showdown doesn’t match the picture. The Hateful Eight is a play about men reckoning with their history, while also humiliating and brutalizing the woman that connects them. It’s not a showdown; it’s protracted torture show set in a one-room cabin with a set design meant to project to the rear seats. Its large props are lit with sharp white light, like potential weapons on a murder mystery set.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a2b539c933569e56fd9501536814be3a1dd8933e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
